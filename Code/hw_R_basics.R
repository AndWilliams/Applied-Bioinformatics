x=seq(1:10)
print(x)
x*2 #Multiplied everything inside the vector with a factor of 2
x-1#subtracted 1 from all the numbers but as im noticing with the math operators the vector doesnt really change it just shows you what the answer is without permanently changing the vector
mean(x)#Averages numbers inside the vector
max(x)#finds the largest number in the vector
min(x)#finds the smallest number in the vector
